# Chorales

This was my senior year techlab project in high school that wrote chorales. It uses a [constraint-satisfaction problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Constraint_satisfaction_problem) solver to follow basic part writing rules (no parallel fifths, no parallel octaves, no large jumps for voices other than bass, etc.).

## Getting started

Install the [`lilypond`](http://lilypond.org/) application (which it uses for engraving). If you put the application in a non-standard path (i.e., not `/Applications`) you'll need to update the `lilypond` script in this repo.

Ensure you have [`ghostscript`](http://www.ghostscript.com/) installed. On mac you can install with [`homebrew`](http://brew.sh/index.html) using:

    $ brew install gs

Once the dependencies are installed, you can run the program with:

    $ python current.py
